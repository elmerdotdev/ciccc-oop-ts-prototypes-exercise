// Exercise 1: Create a Prototype
// Instructions: 
// 1. Create a constructor function called "Vehicle" that takes "make" and "model" as arguments.
// 2. Define a method called "startEngine" on the prototype of Vehicle that logs "The [make] [model] engine is starting."



// YOUR CODE HERE




// Test the Vehicle prototype
const myCar = new Vehicle("Toyota", "Corolla");
myCar.startEngine();  // Output: The Toyota Corolla engine is starting.
